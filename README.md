## ⚙️ Environment Variables (Backend)
To run the backend in production, ensure the following variables are configured:
| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | Aiven MySQL Connection String (with `sslMode=REQUIRED`) |
| `DB_USERNAME` / `DB_PASSWORD` | Database credentials |
| `JWT_SECRET` | 256-bit Base64 encoded secret key |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary Account Name |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` / `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary Credentials |
| `EMAIL_USERNAME` | Gmail address for notifications |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | 16-character Google App Password |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | URL of the deployed React application (for CORS) |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The system follows a classic **N-tier Architecture** with a clear separation between the presentation, business logic, and data layers.

    A[React Frontend] -->|REST API + JWT| B[Spring Boot Backend]
    B -->|JPA/Hibernate| C[(MySQL Database - Aiven)]
    B -->|Streaming| D[Cloudinary - Storage]
    B -->|Authentication| E[Spring Security - JWT]
```

### 🔹 Layered Design
- **Presentation Layer**: Built with **React**; uses **Axios** to communicate with the backend. It's fully stateless, relying on JWT tokens stored in the browser.
- **Security Layer**: **Spring Security** intercepts every request, validates the JWT, and enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Service Layer**: Contains the core business logic, including salary calculations, attendance processing, and Cloudinary file handling.
- **Persistence Layer**: **Spring Data JPA** manages the database interactions with MySQL, ensuring data integrity and version control via Hibernate.
